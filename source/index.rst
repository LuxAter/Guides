Programming Style Guides
========================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large code base when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

"Style" covers a lot of ground, from "use camelCase for variable names" to
"never use global variables" to "never use exceptions". This project links to
the style guidelings used for Google code.
